# Project №6 - SHA256

This project is a console application that implements text hashing <br>
using SHA-256, part of the Secure Hash Algorithm 2(SHA-2).

## Uses of SHA-256

SHA-256 is used in many circumstances, for example:

- To create website authentication schemes, using JWTs, HMACs and MACs <br>
- To create digital signatures <br>
- To secure blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum <br>
- In anti-viruses, to compare the fingerprints of files and programs <br>
- In version control systems like Git to check if data has changed <br>

## Functionalities

The application has the following functionalities:

- Reading a message from a file <br>
- Hashing a message using SHA-256 <br>
- Saving a hashed message to a file <br>
- Reading a hashed message <br>
- Adding a new message from user input <br>
